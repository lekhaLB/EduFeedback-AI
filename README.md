  Uses LLMs to compare student answers with model answers and generate contextual feedback.

- **OCR Integration**  
  Extracts handwritten text from images using Google Cloud Vision API.

- **Textbook Recommendation**  
  Suggests relevant textbook pages based on semantic similarity with student answers.

- **Cloud Image Management**  
  Uploads and serves answer images using Google Cloud Storage.

- **Performance Dashboard**  
  Visualizes student performance trends and feedback through interactive charts.

- **Course & Question Management**  
  Upload and manage questions, model answers, and textbook PDFs.

- **Re-evaluation Support**
